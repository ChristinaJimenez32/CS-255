Driver Pass Project 
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverProject required us to design a system for various users. These users included students, drivers, secretaries, administration, and also the DMV. The purpose was to provide the customers with the ability to select driving lesson courses and sessions in order to pass the drivers test. Students needed a system in which they could select packages, input personal information, book appointments and view instructor feedback.Secretaries would also need access to profiles in order to create profiles and appointments for customers. Driver needed a system to provide feeback to students based on their driving. The admin would needed full access to the system, and the DMV would also need a part in the system in order for the course materials to be updated.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well with the project 1 business requirements. I think I did a good job highligjting the functional and nonfuntional requirements. I also think I did well going in depth about the measurable tasks needed for the system to properly function.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my class diagram, I wish I would have added methods and focused more on the relationship between classes. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the users needs by taking into consideration what they had mentioned they wanted the system to do. I made a list of measurable tasks that would ensure that the needs were fulfilled. I think it is important to consider the user's needs since they will be using the system and you want the client or end user to be comfortable using the system and fucntion the way they requested if it is logically possible. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I usually make a list of tasks that have to be completed by the software. However, for more complex project I think creating ULM diagram is extremely beneficial to see the relationships within the system and how the system should fucntion and detail the steps for each case to be completed.
